What is the difference between a merge and a rebase?

When we merge a branch, all the commits from the branch are maintained
and then a final commit is added to the master branch.

When rebasing, the commits from the other branch are rebased onto the 
master branch leading to a linear commit history.

In general, it is better to use merge because rebase destroys the orignal
commit history from the master branch.
